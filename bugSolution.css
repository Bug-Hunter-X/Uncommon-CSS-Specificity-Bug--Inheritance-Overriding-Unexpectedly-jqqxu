The solution involves using the `!important` flag to enforce the `color: green` rule.  This should only be used as a last resort, however, as it can lead to maintainability issues. A better long-term solution may involve restructuring the CSS or adjusting selector specificity to avoid the conflict.

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green !important; /* Using !important to override inheritance */
}

div p.special {
  color: purple;
}
```
