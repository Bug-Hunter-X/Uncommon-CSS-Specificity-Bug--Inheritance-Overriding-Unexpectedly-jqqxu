The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is unexpectedly overridden */
}

div p.special {
  color: purple; /* This rule works as expected */
}
```

The unexpected behavior lies in the `div p` selector.  While one might expect the `color: green` to override the `color: red` of the paragraph, due to the more specific selector, it's often overridden by the `color: blue` from the `div` selector. This highlights a subtle interaction between inheritance and specificity.
